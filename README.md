# SMIS-and-DHIS2-KPI-data-sync

This mediator helps to synchronize KPI value from DHIS2. Two methods are used in order to synchronise KPI values; (1) User triggered sync for a single KPI and (2) OpenHIM triggered sync. KPI in this work is analogues to indicator in DHIS2, which is defined as expressions which can be calculated and presented as a result.

Representation of KPI values returned from DHIS2 could differ based on the parameters we used in our request. Three dimensions(as they are referred to in DHIS2 developer documentation) are used to filter certain KPIs and their values. Those are data dimensions (those include data element, indicator, etc â€¦), period and organization unit. 
explore https://docs.dhis2.org/2.28/en/developer/html/webapi_analytics.html for more detail

The DHIS2 API has many filtering options and parameters you can utilize to perform analytics, but this mediator uses only the required parameters(dimension parameter). Therefore requests to DHIS2 are sent in the following way

https://play.dhis2.org/2.30/api/analytics?dimension=dx:${req.params.dx}&dimension=pe:${req.params.pe}&dimension=ou:${req.params.ou}

With three dynamic values you can pass to filter data elements.

Once results are returned, the mediator performs certain actions on the retrieved data based on your needs.
SUM - Sum of all returned row values
AVERAGE  - Average of all returned row values
LAST  - Last element of the returned rows
MIDDLE  - Middle element of the returned rows
FIRST  - First element of the returned rows

SMIS should pass those flags in the request as parameters




Future works
- More filter parameters
- Data approval status
